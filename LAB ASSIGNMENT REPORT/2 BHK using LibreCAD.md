# Design of 2 BHK plan using LibreCAD(Blocks)
### Objective :- 
Design of 2 BHK plan using LibreCAD and also with the help of _Block_
### Introduction:-
2 BHK apartments are common nowadays for various single couples as they provide free and more spacious place to enjoy the life. Efficient space utilization and thoughtful design are key considerations when we are drafting the floor plan for such residences. LibreCAD offers us useful tools for the completion of such projects moreover to make visualisation into reality LibreCAD tools and its Blocks helps a lot to an engineer .

### Procedure:-
1. Open LibreCAD the LibreCAD software on your computer.

2. Before you begin drawing, set up your drawing parameters such as units (metric or imperial), scale, and grid settings.

3. Start by drawing the outer walls of the apartment. Use the line tool to draw lines representing the walls. You can specify exact dimensions for each wall segment.

4. Once the outer walls are drawn, add internal walls to create rooms. Again, use the line tool and specify dimensions accurately.

5. Use the door and window tools to insert openings for doors and windows. Make sure to place them accurately in relation to the walls.

6. Now, add furnishings like beds, sofas, tables, and fixtures like sinks, stoves, etc. You can either draw these objects yourself or use existing CAD blocks if available.

7. Label each room and space accordingly. This will make it easier for viewers to understand the layout.

8. Add dimensions to your drawing to indicate the sizes of rooms, doors, windows, etc. This is crucial for understanding the scale of the floor plan.

9. Once you've completed the basic floor plan, review it carefully for any errors or inconsistencies.
