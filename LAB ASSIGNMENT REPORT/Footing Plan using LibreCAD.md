### Procedure:-
1. Open LibreCAD on your computer.

2. Start a new drawing or open an existing one. Set up the drawing units, grid settings, and drawing scale according to your requirements.

3. Use the Line tool or the Rectangle tool to draw a square representing the dimensions of the isolated footing. Ensure that you accurately specify the dimensions of the square footing according to the design requirements.

4. Use the Dimension tool to add linear dimensions to the sides of the square footing. This will provide clarity on the size of the footing.

5. Use the Text tool to add labels, annotations, and any other relevant information to the drawing. This may include the footing designation, dimensions, material specifications, and any other details required.

6. If your design requires reinforcement within the footing, you can use lines and hatch patterns to represent the reinforcement bars. Ensure that you adhere to the design requirements and standards for reinforcement detailing.

7. Review the drawing to ensure accuracy and completeness. Verify that all dimensions, labels, and details are correctly represented.

8.  Save the drawing file in a suitable format (e.g., DXF, DWG) for future reference and sharing with collaborators or for printing.

### Discussion:-
LibreCAD offers a range of tools and features that allow engineers to design isolated footings with various shapes and dimensions to suit the specific requirements of a project. Whether it's rectangular, square, circular, or custom-shaped footings, LibreCAD provides the tools to accurately draft these designs.

### Conclusion:-
Overall, the use of LibreCAD for designing isolated footings has proven to be a valuable asset in the realm of structural engineering. By leveraging LibreCAD's capabilities, engineers can efficiently create optimized footing designs that prioritize safety, functionality, and cost-effectiveness, ultimately contributing to the success of construction projects.
