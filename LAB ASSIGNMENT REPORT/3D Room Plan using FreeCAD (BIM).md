# 3D Room Plan using FreeCAD (BIM)
### Objective :- 
Design of 3D room plan in FreeCAD using BIM WB
### Introduction:-
Designing a 3D room in FreeCAD using BIM is very interesting task which make us equiped with the BIM WB tools which further can be used in future for designing of buildings and many more structural elements. Moreover as this 3D modal uses various structural elements like **I** shape rebar, slabs, walls etc. which are designed by us only (Specifications) made us acknowledged about the designing part too.

### Procedure:-
 1. Draw four lines with the  Draft Line tool. You can enter coordinates manually, or simply pick the points on the grid with the mouse.
 
 2. Select the first line, then press the  Wall button.
 
 3. Repeat this for the 3 other lines, until you have 4 walls.
 
 4. Select the four walls, and set their Height property to 3.00m and their Alignment property to left. 
 
 5. Press the  Add button. The four walls have now been turned into one.
 
 6. Set the Working Plane to auto so we are not restricted to the ground plane.
 
 7. Press the  Window button.

 8. In the window creation panel, select the Glass door preset, and set its Width to 0.9m and its Height to 2.1m.
 
 9. Create a  rectangle with a length of 5m, a height of 4m, and place it at position x:-0.5m, y:-0.5m, z:0.
 
 10. Click the  structure tool to create a slab from the rectangle.
 
 11. We need now to duplicate this beam a couple of times. We could do that one by one using the  clone tool, but there is a better way, to do all the copies at once using an array.
 
 12. Set the Number of elements for the X direction of the array to 6, set the number for the Y and Z direction to 1, and press OK.

 13. Create a  rectangle, snapping to two opposite points of the border beams.

 14. Click the  structure button and create a slab with a height of 0.2m.
 
 15. Select the two slabs, the wall, and the array of beams.
 
 16. Press the  Floor button.
 
 17. Select the floor we just created.
 
 18. Press the  Building button.

### Discussion:-
Creating a 3D model of a room in BIM using FreeCAD empowers architects, engineers, and designers to develop comprehensive and coordinated building designs, leading to improved efficiency, reduced errors, and better project outcomes.

### Conclusion:-
FreeCAD's 3D modeling capabilities enable the creation of realistic renderings and visualizations of the room design. These visualizations are valuable for client presentations, design reviews, and marketing efforts, enhancing communication and understanding of the project.
