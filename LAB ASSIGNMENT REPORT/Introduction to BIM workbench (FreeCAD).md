# Introduction to BIM workbench (FreeCAD)
### Objective :- 
To know and use BIM WB for designing of various 3D drawings in freeCAD.
### Introduction:-
BIM (Building Information Modeling) workbench in FreeCAD is a powerful toolset designed for architects, engineers, and construction professionals to create detailed digital representations of building projects. It facilitates collaboration, visualization, simulation, and analysis throughout the entire lifecycle of a building, from conceptual design to construction and maintenance.

### Procedure:-
1. Open FreeCAD software on your computer to start the design process.

2. Now click on BIM workbench in the toolbar pannel.

3. If incase BIM WB is not there than go to addon manager-click on it-type BIM in search bar-install it-restart the software 

4. Now you have BIM WB on which you can work.

5. Explore all the tools available in WB and get used too them.

6. You will have tools like:-

 **[2D]()** Line,Wire,Circle,Arc,Ellipse,Polygon,Rectangle,etc.

 **[3D]()**  Wall,Curtain Wall,Column,Beam,Slab,Rebar,Window,Door,Pipe tools,Stairs,Panel tools,Frame,Fence,Truss,etc.
