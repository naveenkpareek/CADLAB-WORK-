### Procedure:-
1. Open LibreCAD software on your computer to start the design process.

2. Set up the drawing parameters such as units (e.g., meters, feet), scale, and grid settings based on the project requirements.

3. Use the Line tool to draw the walls of the 1 BHK plan according to the sketch. Ensure that walls are drawn to scale and accurately represent the dimensions of the rooms.

4. Use the Rectangle tool to create openings for doors and windows within the walls. Pay attention to the placement and size of these openings to ensure functionality and aesthetic appeal.

5. Use the Rectangle tool to outline the boundaries of each room within the plan. Label each room accordingly (e.g., Bedroom, Hall, Kitchen).

6. Add fixtures such as sinks, toilets, and kitchen appliances, as well as furniture such as beds, sofas, and dining tables. These elements should be placed strategically to optimize space and functionality.

7. Add details such as dimensions, labels, and annotations to provide clarity and context to the plan. This information will help contractors and builders understand the design intent.

8. Review the 1 BHK plan to ensure accuracy and completeness. Make any necessary modifications or adjustments based on feedback or further analysis.
